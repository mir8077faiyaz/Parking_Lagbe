      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        With the rapid urbanization of Bangladesh, there has been a surge in
        vehicle ownership. Thus the demand for parking space is on the rise and
        the search for a safe parking spot has become a concern among many
        vehicle owners. Often, cars are parked on the road and left unattended,
        which is not only unsafe, but also illegal and can be fined up to 5000
        Tk. Parking on the road can also contribute to traffic congestion which
        is one of the leading causes of inefficiency in our country.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, there is no easy way to find a safe parking space effectively
        and quickly, and although there are many empty parking spaces available
        in buildings, malls and other places, the bridge between space-renters
        and vehicle owners does not exist. Our aim is to provide a system
        solution for the problems addressed above by building a connection
        between vehicle owners and parking-space owners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users who wish to rent their parking spot can register through our
        application by providing necessary information such as their
        identification , location details, garage details, hourly charge, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vehicle owners can also register through our application to provide
        their identification information, vehicle details, contact information,
        etc. Using the “Search-Parking” functionality, users can find available
        parking spaces using geo-location features. They can book a parking spot
        on an hourly basis within given time slots, and through our real-time
        update feature, the parking availability is automatically updated.
